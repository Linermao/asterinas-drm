# On a standard NixOS system, /run/opengl-driver is created and populated
# automatically by systemd-tmpfiles during early boot. The tmpfiles rules
# are responsible for setting up volatile runtime paths under /run and
# linking them to the active OpenGL driver closure (graphics-drivers).
#
# In Asterinas, systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service is intentionally masked and
# not executed at boot time. As a result, the /run/opengl-driver hierarchy
# is never created automatically, even though Mesa and the graphics-drivers
# derivation are correctly built and present in the Nix store.
#
# To allow Mesa, GBM, and GLX-based applications (e.g. glxinfo, Xorg) to
# locate their runtime driver files, we manually create a symbolic link
# from /run/opengl-driver to the active graphics-drivers store path here.
#
# This is a temporary workaround for debugging and bring-up. Once
# systemd-tmpfiles support is enabled (or an equivalent init-time mechanism
# is provided), this manual setup should be removed.
